     * Purpose: Illustrate process for importing STL, rendering to Grid, output to new Grid
     * 
     * Example Concepts:
     *  1) Create IGrid by API
     *  2) Loading ITriangles from STL file
     *  3) Rendering ITriangles to an IGrid
     *  4) Rendering 3D IGrid to oblique 2D IGrid
     *  5) Saving IGrid to PNG file
