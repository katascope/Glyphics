Layers (top to bottom)
Layer 4 [Glyphics API] 
Layer 3 [Language] [Renderers] [Painters]
Layer 2 [ByteGrid]
Layer 1 [Atomics]
Layer 0 [Glyphics Interfaces]


Code is easiest to write
Tokens are easiest to execute
Bytecode is smallest code to encode
---------Execution barrier---------
Grids are easiest to draw to
Rects are easiest and smallest to serialize
Triangles are easiest to render or print
Elements are easiest to UI manipulate
Transforms are elements without properties

Grids/Rects/Triangles/Elements/Quads/Transforms are also: 
- Octree
- Palettes
- Images(and all associated like normal/texture/light-maps, cellular automata-map)
- Voxel/point-clouds
- Cube-maps(if you consider them as inverted in 6d), 
- UI Windows
- Physics simulation
- Emergent.. how? 



Images are just small grids
Palettes are just small grids

Scenes are sets of elements
Decks are sets of sccenes

TrianglesLists are sets of triangles
